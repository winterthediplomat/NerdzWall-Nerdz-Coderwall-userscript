Coderwall has some neat APIs.
Nerdz supports userscripts.
I want to learn JavaScript.
I have a lot a spare time.

This is the result: a Nerdz userscript that shows
Coderwall badges of a user (if registered on Coderwall, obv).
Simple and useless, isn't it?

INSTALL
>log in on Nerdz
>click on "Preferences" link
>open the "Profile" tab
>insert the link of "raw version" of the script in the Userscript field.
>enjoy.
